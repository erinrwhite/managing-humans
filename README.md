## rough outline

- hiring
    - writing job descriptions: make the job interesting, fight for good pay
    - posting: emphasize non-pay benefits, 10/20% time
    - interviewing: what was the last script you wrote? can you teach yourself? do you speak fondly of your ex-employers?
    - take 'em out to lunch the first day, c'mon
- retaining
    - prioritize: your folks, your boss, everybody else
    - let 'em know you know they won't be there forever
    - critique ideas not people
    - say hard things honestly
- be a model
    - take vacation, no seriously and leave it at work if you can
    - tell the truth but don't poison the well
- know yourself and your limitations
- tell them how you work: be honest about your motivations, pressures, goals, and how you work best
