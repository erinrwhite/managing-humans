## description

Managing projects is one thing, but managing people is another. Whether
we’re hired as managers or grow “organically” into management roles,
sometimes technical people end up leading technical teams (gasp!). I’ll
talk about lessons I’ve learned about hiring, retaining, and working
long-term and day-to-day with highly tech-competent humans. I’ll also
talk about navigating the politics of libraryland, juggling different
types of projects, and working with constrained budgets to make good
things and keep talented people engaged.

### sybil's description

New managers are often promoted without receiving management training,
yet management is not something you just figure out. The experience of
being expected to know how to manage, yet not being trained to do so
often results in new managers feeling isolated and unsure how to move
from making to managing. In this talk I’ll focus on my own managerial
experience of designing and leading an archival tech team in a small
independent archives. Topics covered will include hiring, delegating,
creating a team culture, and leading people whose specialized knowledge
exceeds your own. The talk take-aways should be applicable to managers
and employees at large and small institutions alike.

## rough outline

- becoming a manager
- """managing""" in libraryland
    + working managers lol
    + sybil's talk fits in here?
- our typical view of managers (lumberg on office space) vs service-based management philosophy: I'm here to give strategic direction then GTFO
- hiring
    - writing job descriptions: make the job interesting, fight for good pay
    - posting: emphasize non-pay benefits, 10/20% time
    - interviewing: what was the last script you wrote? can you teach yourself? do you speak fondly of your ex-employers?
    - take 'em out to lunch the first day, c'mon
    - i don't have any damn money!
- retaining
    - let 'em know you know they won't be there forever
    - i don't have any damn money!
    - critique ideas not people
    - say hard things honestly
- working long-term
    - prioritize: your folks, your boss, everybody else
    - be a model
        - take vacation, no seriously and leave it at work if you can
        - tell the truth but don't poison the well
    - know yourself and your limitations
- working day-to-day
    - tell them how you work: be honest about your motivations, pressures, goals ,and how you work best
- politics of libraryland!
- juggling types of projects
    + maintenance vs innovation
    + core vs. satellite (thanks BYU, holler)
    + momentum, engagement, agency
    + new technologies
