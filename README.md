Programmers are not projects: lessons learned from managing humans
===============

[code4lib 2015 talk](http://code4lib.org/conference/2015/white)

Managing projects is one thing, but managing people is another. Whether
we’re hired as managers or grow “organically” into management roles,
sometimes technical people end up leading technical teams (gasp!). I’ll
talk about lessons I’ve learned about hiring, retaining, and working
long-term and day-to-day with highly tech-competent humans. I’ll also
talk about navigating the politics of libraryland, juggling different
types of projects, and working with constrained budgets to make good
things and keep talented people engaged.

## outline

### introduction
Hi folks, I'm Erin White and I am the web systems librarian at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA. Today I'm going to talk about...managing people. Super-scintillating stuff.

You're probably wondering if I'm going to cover the same stuff as Sybil. Well, the answer is, there may be overlap, but we schemed ahead of time to avoid dwelling on similar topics so we wouldn't bore you. You're welcome!

The gist of my talk today is: "soft" skills are hard, be a human and recognize that others are, too.

### "soft" skills are hard
The conference schedule this year isn't just about code.  I'm happy about that. So often we relegate things like management, communications, project management, UX, work-life balance, benefits, and equity issues to the back burner, as not "the work we do". We code only! Our work is about hard skills and that's it! 

Well, not so much.

Hard skills are rule-based. Algorithms, syntax, functions, standards, best practices. Hard skills are somewhat master-able.

Soft skills are human-based. They change. They are contextual, societal, social, personal. Soft skills are really damn hard. And they have just as much impact on our work.

I'd probably be more comfortable up here talking about an app we developed. But I think it's more important to talk about this and I'm glad you thought so, too. I hope that we'll continue to see sessions like this at Code4Libs future, and some sessions like this coming from people who aren't women, too.


### my story
I started work at VCU straight out of library school doing web design and development. When my supervisor left 6 months after I started work, I stepped in and became the manager of the web team. 

The stakes were low - at the time, "the web team" was me and a part-time programmer who had been there a long time, knew what he was doing, and understood the environment.

When he left shortly thereafter, things got real. Though part of me was excited I was Getting Management Experience(TM), I was mostly just terrified. I had to recruit, hire, train and retain a new person. I had to set the direction. And over the course of 5 years, a revolving door of hirings for part-time and full-time positions, and some foibles, I can say that I am slightly better at managing people than I was in 2010. Now I manage two full-time employees who have been here for a spell and haven't quit yet. (Success?)

### """managing""" in libraryland

Let me diverge here briefly to talk about management in libraryland: in general, it's haphazard and folks going into management positions are ill-prepared. In the kind of environment where you want to spend the little development money you have on conferences like Code4Lib, management training doesn't make the cut (this goes back to the soft skills idea from earlier).

So, newbie managers + very little admin support for training = lots of "room for growth" = nervous humans

As an added bonus, many library managers are "working managers" which is a nice way to say we have a bunch of stuff we do in addition to managing folks. Hats off to any managers who get any amount of your own work done, have happy employees, and only work 40 hours a week.
    
### being a human

Why am I talking about this? Why the hell do I have a slide about "being a human"? Shouldn't we all be good at this by now?

Well, I won't speak for everybody but I do know that I made a lot of assumptions about how good a boss I'd be before I was a boss. I assumed that being a boss was like being a regular person on a team with some added paperwork. It's really not. The power dynamic changes when you are in a formal management position and the rules you follow for "how to be a human person" change. You're no longer a friend or an equal or a confidante, nor are you viewed as one. And that's okay. It's just different.

#### ass+u+me

Our typical view of managers has been framed by depictions of inept, buttoned-up, cubicle-lurking pointy-heads - Dilbert and Office Space come to mind. That view of managers is a depiction of the typical command-based management style: I tell you what to do, you do it without asking questions, grrrrreaaaat. The command-based manager assumes that you naturally are up to no good, that you don't want to work, that you'`re disengaged. Has anybody ever had a boss who clearly thought like this? Yeah, me too. The wording is blunt, but *this is actually how a lot of managers still think* and how a lot of people are taught to think as managers. Wow!

More and more, though, we hear about a newer type of manager - the service-based manager who empowers his/her team and becomes the conduit for that team's work. This manager guides strategic direction, sets goals and lets the team decide how to get there with as little obstruction as possible. This is the ideal situation and one that encourages people to do good work that they can stand behind. Doing this is really hard!

So, the first step of being human is recognizing your own assumptions about your team and making sure that they align with where you need to be. Rather than assume the worst, my assumption is that the people on my team are *curious, mission-driven tinkerers* who want to be here. All assumptions about the work they do flows from there.

#### your work, lol

Speaking of "the work your team does" - do you know that saying, "your work isn't your work anymore when you're a manager"? It's true. Your work is your team's work. It took me a while to get over the fact that at the end of each day, I hadn't lovingly crafted a thing with my own hands. Despite my sadness I have developed a few rules of thumb:

 - Don't roadblock. When possible, take yourself out of the development workflow. Do you really need to code on this project? 
 - Cross-train your team, document, and delegate. It is not lazy! In fact, it helps your team work faster and helps people get new skills.
 - Prioritize: your job is to help your team get their crap done, and anything you're working on comes second.

Letting go can be hard, especially if you're really close to your old job responsibilities. This is one I've learned the hard way: when hiring someone new into your old position, make sure you relinquish *all* of the responsibilities for that position. Communicate your expectations and then let it go. If you're feeling bold, tell that person to tell you when you're being too hands-on. Many people are too nice to do this but just saying it out loud will put pressure on you to mind your dang manners.

#### staying current

Though I just said to stay out of the active development workflow, I also try to keep somewhat current on our code stack so I can speak intelligently to my team about problems we're trying to solve. Generally I pick small, non-urgent maintenance requests that I can commit and fix. This is also a great way to test documentation. :D :D :D

#### communicate

I think a manager's biggest job is talking with your team. Communicating context, important political or historical factors that will impact work, audience for projects, timelines, feedback, everything. And, making sure that their voices and needs are heard in the levels above you.

In general, I try to be as transparent as possible. There is such thing as TMI, though, and that is when the info I'm conveying is a negative attitude about other people in the organization. This is rarely helpful and always poisons the well. Being kind a jerk signals to your team that it's okay to be a jerk. Be honest but don't be a jerk. As my boss said to me recently, "We're all smart here. Try to be kind."

Other things I've finally learned to communicate: the rationale for decisions, changes, etc., including my motivations, goals, relationships with stakeholders in the library, and political things that are impacting a project. Most recently: "I got X committee to set their own deadline because we've set the deadlines for them many times in the past few years."

Another thing I have gotten better at communicating nowadays: areas where I screwed up. It's really liberating. As long as something's learned from it, it's fine.

#### case study: the clench

A thing I've learned about myself as a manager is that I really fear change. I have a hard time with big new project ideas, or changing up the way things have been done for a long time, or the idea of new technologies...the list really goes on. 

I like to call any time I feel fear or defensiveness The Clench. Whenever our developer or designer presents a new idea to me, I say, "thank you for bringing this forward (really, thank you)", ask a few questions, and say let's talk about it again next week. My requirements are: does this project solve a problem or serve our mission? Is this viable? Is this sustainable? If those answers are yes, okay, we're doing it. The Clench subsides.

Hear the idea, feel the clench, ask some questions, give it a minute, pursue the idea.

I have communicated this to my team and this is how they know to work with me. 

#### balance

It's important to recharge and separate yourself, you, human person, from your work, no matter what a curious, mission-driven tinkerer you are. 

It's a sign of trust in your team that you feel comfortable leaving for a week without chiming in on e-mail every day.

And, by taking vacation (reallllly taking vacation) you signal to your team that it's okay for them to do so, too.

If you're worried that something will come up that really does require your attention, give them your phone number. They won't use it but you'll feel better.

Also, unless you are a library director, you don't need to send a dang e-mail at 10 p.m. on a Wednesday. No 10 p.m. email is a good email. Go home.

### recognize that others are humans

Okay, now that we've talked about some ways to appear to be a human being to your employees, let's talk about the humans you manage.

#### hiring

- writing job descriptions: make the job interesting, fight for good pay
- posting: emphasize non-pay benefits, 10/20% time
- interviewing: what was the last script you wrote? can you teach yourself? do you speak fondly of your ex-employers?
- take 'em out to lunch the first day, c'mon
- onboarding checklist
- working with not enough damn money
- mission-driven work

#### retaining

- let 'em know you know they won't be there forever
- working with not enough damn money
- critique ideas not people
- say hard things honestly
- check in, ask how they want to grow, where they see themselves
- tell them how you work: be honest about your motivations, pressures, goals and how you work best
- ask them how they'd prefer to hear from you
- one channel if possible
- are they big-picture or task-oriented?

#### working day-to-day

- weekly one-on-ones
- politics of libraryland!
- juggling types of projects
    + maintenance vs innovation
    + core vs. satellite (thanks BYU, holler)
    + momentum, engagement, agency
    + new technologies for satellite projects then move into core
- libraryland is weird
    - be the poo umbrella
    - communicate stakeholders and the feedback process and how that feedback will be used
- when shit hits the fan
    + it almost always comes down to communications issues
    + did i give this person enough information to succeed?
    + was this an error?
    +   blameless postmortems
    + life or death is just not a thing
    + is it a problem with a person?

### bye

That's all I have to say. Thank you for your time, Code4Lib!
