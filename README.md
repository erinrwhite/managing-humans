Programmers are not projects: lessons learned from managing humans
===============

[code4lib 2015 talk](http://code4lib.org/conference/2015/white)

Managing projects is one thing, but managing people is another. Whether
we’re hired as managers or grow “organically” into management roles,
sometimes technical people end up leading technical teams (gasp!). I’ll
talk about lessons I’ve learned about hiring, retaining, and working
long-term and day-to-day with highly tech-competent humans. I’ll also
talk about navigating the politics of libraryland, juggling different
types of projects, and working with constrained budgets to make good
things and keep talented people engaged.

## outline

### introduction
Hi folks, I'm Erin White and I am the web systems librarian at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA. Today I'm going to talk about...managing people. Super-scintillating stuff.

You're probably wondering if I'm going to cover the same stuff as Sybil. Well, the answer is, there may be overlap, but we schemed ahead of time to avoid dwelling on similar topics so we wouldn't bore you. You're welcome!

The gist of my talk today is: "soft" skills are hard, be a human and recognize that others are, too.

### "soft" skills are hard
The conference schedule this year isn't just about code.  I'm happy about that. So often we relegate things like management, communications, project management, UX, work-life balance, benefits, and equity issues to the back burner, as not "the work we do". We code only! Hard skills! That's it. 

Not so much.

Hard skills are rule-based. Algorithms, syntax, functions, standards, best practices. Hard skills are somewhat master-able.

Soft skills are human-based. They change. They are contextual, societal, social, personal. Soft skills are really dang hard. And they have just as much impact on our work.

I'd probably be more comfortable up here talking about an app we developed. But I think it's more important to talk about this and I'm glad you thought so, too.

### my story
I started work at VCU straight out of library school doing web design and development. When my supervisor left 6 months after I started work, I stepped in and became the manager of the web team. 

The stakes were low - at the time, it was me and a part-time programmer who had been there a long time, knew what he was doing, and understood the environment.

When he left, things got real.  Though part of me was excited I was Getting Management Experience(TM), I was mostly just terrified. I had to recruit, hire, train and retain a new person. I had to set the direction. And over the course of 5 years, a revolving door of hirings for part-time and full-time positions, and some foibles, I can say that I am slightly better at managing people than I was in 2010. Now I manage two full-time employees who have been here for a spell and they haven't quit yet.

### """managing""" in libraryland

Let me diverge here briefly to talk about management in libraryland: in general, it's haphazard and folks going into management positions are ill-prepared. And, so often in academic libraries at least, capital-L librarians are more likely than non-librarians to become managers, despite their levels of experience. And in the kind of environment where librarians want to spend development money on conferences like ALA and Code4Lib, management training doesn't make the cut (this goes back to the soft skills idea from earlier).

So, newbie managers + very little admin support for training = lots of "room for growth" = nervous humans

As an added bonus, many library managers are "working managers" which is a nice way to say we have a bunch of stuff we do in addition to managing folks. Hats off to any managers who get any amount of your own work done, have happy employees, and only work 40 hours a week.
    
### be a human

- our typical view of managers (lumberg on office space) vs service-based management philosophy: I'm here to give strategic direction then GTFO
- be a model
    - tell the truth but don't poison the well. Model the attitudes you'd like to see
    - know yourself and your limitations, communicate that
    - communicate your goals and pressures, say why you are making decisions
    - take vacation, seriously, and leave work at work if you can
        - email at 10 p.m.? why



### recognize that others are humans

- hiring
    - writing job descriptions: make the job interesting, fight for good pay
    - posting: emphasize non-pay benefits, 10/20% time
    - interviewing: what was the last script you wrote? can you teach yourself? do you speak fondly of your ex-employers?
    - take 'em out to lunch the first day, c'mon
    - onboarding checklist
    - working with not enough damn money
    - mission-driven work
- retaining
    - let 'em know you know they won't be there forever
    - working with not enough damn money
    - critique ideas not people
    - say hard things honestly
- working long-term
    - prioritize order of operations: your folks, your boss, everybody else
    - check in, ask how they want to grow, where they see themselves
- working day-to-day
    - tell them how you work: be honest about your motivations, pressures, goals and how you work best
    - weekly one-on-ones
    - politics of libraryland!
- juggling types of projects
    + maintenance vs innovation
    + core vs. satellite (thanks BYU, holler)
    + momentum, engagement, agency
    + new technologies for satellite projects then move into core
- libraryland is weird
    - be the poo umbrella
    - communicate stakeholders and the feedback process and how that feedback will be used
- when shit hits the fan
    + it almost always comes down to communications issues
    + did i give this person enough information to succeed?
    + was this an error?
    +   blameless postmortems
    + life or death is just not a thing
    + is it a problem with a person?
fundamental attribution error
curious, mission-driven tinkerers
management is not leadership - doing things right vs doing the right things
fear, shame, 
    say when you don't know, recognize when you fear change, acknowledge the clench
    say when you messed up

### bye

That's all I have to say. Thank you for your time, Code4Lib!
